# XLA

Precompiled [XLA](https://github.com/openxla/xla) binaries for [EXLA](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla).

## Usage

EXLA already depends on this package, so you generally don't need to install it yourself.
There is however a number of environment variables that you may want to use in order to
customize the variant of XLA binary.

The binaries are always built/downloaded to match the current configuration, so you should
set the environment variables in `.bash_profile` or a similar configuration file so you don't
need to export it in every shell session.

#### `XLA_TARGET`

The default value is `cpu`, which implies the final the binary supports targeting
only the host CPU.

| Value | Target environment |
| --- | --- |
| cpu | |
| tpu | libtpu |
| cuda120 | CUDA 12.1+, cuDNN 8.9+ |
| cuda118 | CUDA 11.8+, cuDNN 8.6+ |
| cuda | CUDA x.y, cuDNN (building from source only) |
| rocm | ROCm (building from source only) |

To use XLA with NVidia GPU you need [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) compatible with your GPU drivers.
See [the installation instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html)
and [the cuDNN support matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/support-matrix/index.html)
for version compatibility. To use precompiled XLA binaries specify a target matching
your CUDA version (like `cuda118`). You can find your CUDA version by running `nvcc --version`
(note that `nvidia-smi` shows the highest supported CUDA version, not the installed one).
When building from source it's enough to specify `cuda` as the target.

Note that all the precompiled binaries assume glibc 2.31 or newer.

##### Notes for ROCm

For GPU support, we primarily rely on CUDA, because of the popularity and availability
in the cloud. In case you use ROCm and it does not work, please open up an issue and
we will be happy to help.

#### `XLA_BUILD`

Defaults to `false`. If `true` the binary is built locally, which may be intended
if no precompiled binary is available for your target environment. Once set, you
must run `mix deps.clean xla --build` explicitly to force XLA to recompile.
Building has a number of dependencies, see *Building from source* below.

#### `XLA_ARCHIVE_URL`

A URL pointing to a specific build of the `.tar.gz` archive. When using this option
you need to make sure the build matches your OS, CPU architecture and the XLA target.

#### `XLA_CACHE_DIR`

The directory to store the downloaded and built archives in. Defaults to the standard
cache location for the given operating system.

#### `XLA_TARGET_PLATFORM`

The target triplet describing the target platform, such as `aarch64-linux-gcc`. By default
this target is inferred for the host, however you may want to override this when cross-compiling
the project using Nerves.

#### `XLA_HTTP_HEADERS`

Headers to use when querying and downloading the precompiled archive. By default the
requests are sent to GitHub, unless `XLA_ARCHIVE_URL` specifies otherwise. The headers
should be a list following this format: `Key1: Value1; Key2: value2`.

## Building from source

To build the XLA binaries locally you need to set `XLA_BUILD=true` and possibly `XLA_TARGET`.
Keep in mind that the compilation usually takes a very long time.

You will need the following installed in your system for the compilation:

  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for fetching XLA source
  * [Bazel v6.1.2](https://bazel.build/) for compiling XLA
  * [Python3](https://python.org) with NumPy installed for compiling XLA

If running on Windows, you will also need:

  * [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
  * [Microsoft Build Tools 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
  * [Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

### Common issues

#### Bazel version

Use `bazel --version` to check your Bazel version, make sure you are using v6.1.2.
Most binaries are available on [Github](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases),
but it can also be installed with `asdf`:

```shell
asdf plugin-add bazel
asdf install bazel 6.1.2
asdf global bazel 6.1.2
```

#### GCC

You may have issues with newer and older versions of GCC. XLA builds are known to work
with GCC versions between 7.5 and 9.3. If your system uses a newer GCC version, you can
install an older version and tell Bazel to use it with `export CC=/path/to/gcc-{version}`
where version is the GCC version you installed.

#### Python and asdf

`Bazel` cannot find `python` installed via the `asdf` version manager by default. `asdf` uses a
function to lookup the specified version of a given binary, this approach prevents `Bazel` from
being able to correctly build XLA. The error is `unknown command: python. Perhaps you have to reshim?`.
There are two known workarounds:

1. Explicitly change your `$PATH` to point to a Python installation (note the build process
   looks for `python`, not `python3`). For example:

    ```shell
    # Point directly to a specific Python version
    export PATH=$HOME/.asdf/installs/python/3.10.8/bin:$PATH
    ```

2. Use the [`asdf direnv`](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-direnv) plugin to install [`direnv 2.20.0`](https://direnv.net).
   `direnv` along with the `asdf-direnv` plugin will explicitly set the paths for any binary specified
   in your project's `.tool-versions` files.

If you still get the error, you can also try setting `PYTHON_BIN_PATH`, like `export PYTHON_BIN_PATH=/usr/bin/python3.9`.

After doing any of the steps above, it may be necessary to clear the build cache by removing ` ~/.cache/xla_extension`.

### GPU support

To build binaries with GPU support, you need all the GPU-specific dependencies (CUDA, ROCm),
then you can build with either `XLA_TARGET=cuda` or `XLA_TARGET=rocm`. See the `XLA_TARGET`
for more details.

### TPU support

All you need is setting `XLA_TARGET=tpu`.

### Compilation-specific environment variables

You can use the following env vars to customize your build:

  * `BUILD_CACHE` - controls where to store XLA source and builds

  * `BUILD_FLAGS` - additional flags passed to Bazel

  * `BUILD_MODE` - controls to compile `opt` (default) artifacts or `dbg`, example: `BUILD_MODE=dbg`

## Runtime flags

You can further configure XLA runtime options with `XLA_FLAGS`,
see: [xla/debug_options_flags.cc](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/debug_options_flags.cc)
for the list of available flags.

## Release process

To publish a new version of this package:

1. Update version in `mix.exs`.
2. Create and push a new tag.
3. Wait for the release workflow to build all the binaries.
4. Publish the release from draft.
5. Publish the package to Hex.
